Potential quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms for use encrypting/decrypting within Anubis
*NTRU
*NewHope
*McEliece
*AES_256 (Large key size is a MUST) - Potentially quantum resistant due to not being suceptible to shor's algorithm 
though Grover's algorithm does pose a potential threat

Hashing
*BCrypt - Tried and tested hashing algorithm which will be the primary algorithm for hashing and salting user passwords
*Argon2 - New hashing algorithm which appears to have slight advantages over BCrypt in the realm of parallelism due to the addition of memory requirements, forcing an attacker to trade significant cost for equal paralellism. Though Argon2 has a slight advantage it has not been scruitinised as much as BCrypt. Once Argon2 has faced comparable scrutiny and still appears to have advantages over BC

Dramatis Personae to display the functions of Anubis
*Alice (Participant)
*Bob (Participant)
*Trent (Trusted Arbitrator)
*Mallory (Malicious Attacker)
*Eve (Eavesdropper)
*P (Plaintext)
*C (Ciphertext)
*E (Encrypt)
*D (Decrypt)
*H (Hash)
*S (Salt)

Example of how messages are sent and received on Anubis using RSA as an example
1 - Alice > Write message P > Select send to Bob > (P)^E=C > Send C to Bob
* C sent over network
2 - Bob > Receives C > C automatically decrypted > (C)^D=P > P displayed on Bobs messenger
3 - Bob > Write response P > Select send to Alice > (P)^E=C > Send C to Alice
* C sent over network
4 - Alice > Receives C > C automatically decrypted > (C)^D=P > P displayed on Alices messenger

Example of how accounts are generated
1 - Alice > Select create new account > Enter username P > Enter password P twice > If passwords match password = P
2 - Hashing password P - H(P)=C > Salting C - S(C)=C > Store Username P alongside password C in database
3 - Alice selects login > Enter Username P > Enter password P > Hashing password P - H(P)=C > Salting C - S(C)=C
4 - If username P in database > if hashed+salted password C matches value in database connected to username P > Login successful
